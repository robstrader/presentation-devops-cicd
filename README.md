## Why do this presentation

The goal of this presentation is to show how to use CI/CD tools to automate the testing and deployment of a web application.

The why is more important than the what. The importance of continuous intergration, automated testing and continuous deployment is not just about the tools, but about the process. It is about the DevOps principles of flow, feedback, and continuous learning. It is about the culture of collaboration and shared responsibility and how to be a good steward of a project with a community of developers.

I want to touch on the history of DevOps, what problem it solves, and how it is a key part of modern software development.
