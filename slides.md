# What is CI/CD?

## Continuous Integration (CI)

The practice of merging code changes into a shared repository frequently, ideally several times a day. Each merge triggers an automated build and test process to verify that the changes did not break the application.

## Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment (CD)

The practice of automatically deploying code changes to a shared repository to a production environment. Continuous Delivery means that the code is always in a deployable state, but the deployment is triggered manually. Continuous Deployment means that the code is automatically deployed to production.

# What is DevOps?

DevOps refers to a set of practices that integrates software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to streamline the systems development life cycle. Its primary goal is to achieve faster and more reliable delivery of high-quality software.

Beyond being a methodology, DevOps can be described as a culture or movement that fosters collaboration and communication among software developers, IT professionals, and other stakeholders involved in the software development process.

# Shiki Magic Move

Powered by [shiki-magic-move](https://shiki-magic-move.netlify.app/), Slidev supports animations across multiple code snippets.

Add multiple code blocks and wrap them with <code>````md magic-move</code> (four backticks) to enable the magic move. For example:

````md magic-move {lines: true}
```ts {*|2|*}
// step 1
const author = reactive({
  name: "John Doe",
  books: [
    "Vue 2 - Advanced Guide",
    "Vue 3 - Basic Guide",
    "Vue 4 - The Mystery",
  ],
});
```

```ts {*|1-2|3-4|3-4,8}
// step 2
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      author: {
        name: "John Doe",
        books: [
          "Vue 2 - Advanced Guide",
          "Vue 3 - Basic Guide",
          "Vue 4 - The Mystery",
        ],
      },
    };
  },
};
```

```ts
// step 3
export default {
  data: () => ({
    author: {
      name: "John Doe",
      books: [
        "Vue 2 - Advanced Guide",
        "Vue 3 - Basic Guide",
        "Vue 4 - The Mystery",
      ],
    },
  }),
};
```

Non-code blocks are ignored.

```vue
<!-- step 4 -->
<script setup>
const author = {
  name: "John Doe",
  books: [
    "Vue 2 - Advanced Guide",
    "Vue 3 - Basic Guide",
    "Vue 4 - The Mystery",
  ],
};
</script>
```

# Components

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

You can use Vue components directly inside your slides.

We have provided a few built-in components like `<Tweet/>` and `<Youtube/>` that you can use directly. And adding your custom components is also super easy.

```html
<Counter :count="10" />
```

<!-- ./components/Counter.vue -->
<Counter :count="10" m="t-4" />

Check out [the guides](https://sli.dev/builtin/components.html) for more.

<div>

```html
<Tweet id="1390115482657726468" />
```

<Tweet id="1390115482657726468" scale="0.65" />

</div>
</div>

<!--

Also, HTML elements are valid:
<div class="flex w-full">

  <span>Right content</span>
</div>

# Themes

Slidev comes with powerful theming support. Themes can provide styles, layouts, components, or even configurations for tools. Switching between themes by just **one edit** in your frontmatter:

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="t-2">

```yaml
---
theme: default
---
```

```yaml
---
theme: seriph
---
```

<img border="rounded" src="https://github.com/slidevjs/themes/blob/main/screenshots/theme-default/01.png?raw=true" alt="">

<img border="rounded" src="https://github.com/slidevjs/themes/blob/main/screenshots/theme-seriph/01.png?raw=true" alt="">

# Clicks Animations

You can add `v-click` to elements to add a click animation.

<div v-click>

This shows up when you click the slide:

```html
<div v-click>This shows up when you click the slide.</div>
```

</div>

<br>

<v-click>

The <span v-mark.red="3"><code>v-mark</code> directive</span>
also allows you to add
<span v-mark.circle.orange="4">inline marks</span>
, powered by [Rough Notation](https://roughnotation.com/):

```html
<span v-mark.underline.orange>inline markers</span>
```

</v-click>

<div mt-20 v-click>

# Motions

Motion animations are powered by [@vueuse/motion](https://motion.vueuse.org/), triggered by `v-motion` directive.

```html

  :enter="{ x: 0 }"
  :click-3="{ x: 80 }"
  :leave="{ x: 1000 }"

```

<div class="w-60 relative">
  <div class="relative w-40 h-40">

# Monaco Editor

Slidev provides built-in Monaco Editor support.

Add `{monaco}` to the code block to turn it into an editor:

```ts {monaco}
import { ref } from "vue";
import { emptyArray } from "./external";

const arr = ref(emptyArray(10));
```

Use `{monaco-run}` to create an editor that can execute the code directly in the slide:

```ts {monaco-run}
import { version } from "vue";
import { emptyArray, sayHello } from "./external";

sayHello();
console.log(`vue ${version}`);
console.log(
  emptyArray<number>(10).reduce(
    (fib) => [...fib, fib.at(-1)! + fib.at(-2)!],
    [1, 1],
  ),
);
```
