# What are we building?

A simple Vite Single Page Application (SPA) with a few components, a test suite and a deployment pipeline.

- **Vite** - A modern build tool for frontend projects.
- **Vitest** - A test runner for Vite.
- **GitHub Actions** - A CI/CD tool for GitHub repositories.
- **GitHub Pages** - A free static site hosting service.

<!--
- Briefly discus each of these tools and what they do.
- Mention that these are just tools, and that they could easily be replaced with others, but the principles would remain the same.
- These are examples of how to implement CI/CD, so let's discuss what CI/CD is.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

<br />

- Combines code frequently to prevent "integration hell".
- Catches bugs early with automated tests.
- Saves time by automating builds and testing.
- Keeps the team aligned with the latest code.
- Ensures software is stable and ready to use.

<br />

<v-click>

### Practices

</v-click>

<v-clicks>

- Commit code frequently to a shared repository.
- Run automated tests on each change.
- Fix bugs as soon as they are detected.
- Keep builds fast and reliable.

</v-clicks>

<!--
- There is only one interesting version of the code.
- Changes are always visible.
- Makes code reviewing so much easier.
- Keep unfinished features unreachable or behind a feature flag.

## Continuous Delivery (CD)

<br />

- Ensures code is ready for deployment.
- Verifies changes through automated tests.
- Reduces risk by deploying smaller, tested updates.
- Rapid delivery with high quality.
- Allows teams to release manually or automatically.

<br />

<v-click>

### Practices

</v-click>
<v-clicks>

- Code passes all tests before deployment.
- Use automation to deploy updates efficiently.
- Deploy smaller, incremental changes.
- Monitor deployments for issues.

</v-clicks>

<!--
- Shortens the lengths of plans. Keep plans small.
- Recover quickly from failures.
- Comes from the Agile Manifesto.
- Logical extension of CI.
- Try to disprove that the software is in a good state.
- Releasibility is the target, which makes releasing a business decision, not a technical one.

# Principles of DevOps

::left::

- **Flow:**

  - Prioritize the flow to customers.
  - Minimize bottlenecks.

- **Feedback:**

  - Amplify feedback.
  - Shorten feedback loops.
  - Encourage collaboration.

- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - Create a culture of experimentation.
  - Learn from failures.
  - Share knowledge.
